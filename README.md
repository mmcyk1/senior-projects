# Hello There
If you are viewing this Github page, you are now viewing my work and code referrences I used during my high school senior projects class.
This page includes two other users code that I used as well as two sketches and the final code.
You are avaliable to look around and use the code. The others users code also have citiations to view their orginal Github and fourm page.
Mitch also has a YouTube channel and a tutorial detailing the code he used. I would recommend viewing these videos for an explanation on how the code works.
Thanks for viewing!
